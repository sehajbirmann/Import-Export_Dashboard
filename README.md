# Import-Export_Dashboard
Data visualization project to analyze India's international trade dynamics. Included comprehensive dataset spanning 2010-2018 with 70,031 rows and 7 columns, detailing commodities, countries, etc. Transformed raw data into impactful visualizations to convey trends and correlations.


India exports approximately 7500 commodities to about 190 countries, and imports around 6000 commodities from 140 countries. India exported 319.2billionandimported 462.9 billion worth of commodities in 2014. The Government of India's Economic Survey 2017–18 noted that five states — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana — accounted for 70% of India's total exports. It was the first time that the survey included international export data for states. The survey found a high correlation between a state's Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) per capita and its share of total exports. With a high GSDP per capita but low export share, Kerala was the only major outlier because the state's GSDP per capita was heavily influenced by remittances. The survey also found that the largest firms in India contributed to a smaller percentage of exports when compared to countries like Brazil, Germany, Mexico, and the United States. The top 1% of India's companies accounted for 38% of total exports.
We have 2 files 2018-2010_export.csv which contains export data from 2010-2018 2018-2010_import.csv which contains import data from 2010-2018 Our goal is to visualize Indian Export and Import data using beautiful graphs
The Features in both the files are as follows: -
**HSCode**: - The Harmonized System is a standardized numerical method of classifying traded products. It is used by customs authorities around the world to identify products when assessing duties and taxes and for gathering statistics.
**Commodity**: - Name of commodity as per HS2
**value**: - Value of Export or Import according to data frames
**country**: - Country of Export or Import according to data frames
**year**: - Year of Import or Export
**Language used**: R
**Software used**: Tableau, R Studio.

Dataset after pre-processing contains 70,031 rows and 7 columns.
